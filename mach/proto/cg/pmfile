-- Revision history
-- $Log$
-- Revision 1.3  2007-02-20 00:45:19  dtrg
-- Done a major overhaul of the way target include files are installed and
-- how platform libraries are built. The ARCH pm variable has now been
-- renamed PLATFORM (which is more accurate) and a different ARCH
-- variable added, which represents the CPU family rather than the
-- hardware platform.
--
-- Revision 1.2  2006/10/15 00:28:12  dtrg
-- Updated to the version 0.1 of Prime Mover (which involves some syntax changes).
--
-- Revision 1.1  2006/07/20 23:18:19  dtrg
-- First version in CVS.
