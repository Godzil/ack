/* A 'long' set is represented as a linear list of 'elemholder'
 * records. Every such record contains a pointer to an element
 * of the set and to the next elemholder. An empty set is
 * represented as a null pointer.
 * An element of a long set must be of some pointer type or,
 * in any case, must have the size of a pointer. Note that
 * the strict typing rules are not obeyed here.
 * This package implements the usual operations on sets.
 * The name of every operation is preceeded by a 'L' to
 * distinguish it from the operation on 'compact' (bitvector)
 * sets with a similar name.
