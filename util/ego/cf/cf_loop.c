/* The algorithm to detect loops that is used here is taken
 * from: Aho & Ullman, Principles of Compiler Design, section 13.1.
 * The algorithm uses the dominator relation between nodes
 * of the control flow graph:
 *  d DOM n => every path from the initial node to n goes through d.
 * The dominator relation is recorded via the immediate dominator tree
 * (b_idom field of bblock struct) from which the dominator relation
 * can be easily computed (see procedure 'dom' below).
 * The algorithm first finds 'back edges'. A back edge is an edge
 * a->b in the flow graph whose head (b) dominates its tail (a).
 * The 'natural loop' of back edge n->d consists of those nodes
 * that can reach n without going through d. These nodes, plus d
 * form the loop.
 * The whole process is rather complex, because different back edges
 * may result in the same loop and because loops may partly overlap
 * each other (without one being nested inside the other).
